# AX Voice Recorder
## What is it?
**AX Voice Recorder** is a **high quality audio** recorder that **exports to mp3** and has in built support for **audio effects**. With this app, you can directly record high quality studio-like audio with post production on your phone. You can use multiple effects at the same time. No need to edit the recorded audio, just record anywhere on the go! With the **Live Preview** feature, with plugged in bluetooth or wired speakers or headphones, (or even the phone speaker, see below) you can listen to the audio being recorded, or prepare your presets for use during recording. You can use the built-in presets, or create your own settings and save them for later. With direct export to high quality MP3 with configurable encode settings, you can record without worrying about free space.

## Supported effects:
- Audio Compressor

## Key Features
- **Live Preview**: Listen to your voice while recording, or play back live audio without recording. You can use this feature to hear what is being recorded in real time, or hear live feedback from the microphone without recording to create presets. **Note: Using the Live Preview feature directly on the device without connecting headphones will cause a feedback sound** - much like the feedback on a public address system. Use of headphones - Bluetooth or wired - is recommended. The app will switch audio automatically to connected audio devices. You can also change the audio devices in app settings.
- **USB OTG Audio Device support**: Use USB audio interfaces or external soundcards to record audio.
- Floating point precision for high quality audio processing
- Ultra Low latency for lag free recording experience
- Low memory footprint provides great performance on even low end devices
- High performance efficient audio engine
